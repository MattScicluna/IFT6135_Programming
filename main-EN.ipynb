    "For this set of questions, we will explore the use of Convolutional Neural Networks to solve a problem with Biological significance (don't worry, no background knowledge is expected). Every cell in your body contains Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which is essentially the instructions for making all the proteins in your body. DNA can be thought of as a very long string where the alphabet is \\{A,C,T,G\\}.\n",
    "The physical attributes of the DNA string and its characters are not important here, except that ~98% of our DNA is physically inaccessible to external molecules. Understanding which regions of DNA are accessible and why is of great interest to scientists. This motivates learning predictive models which could accurately classify such regions. In particular, we will be implementing the deep network called [Basset](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27197224/).\n"

This is a matrix of size $4$ $\\times$ the motif length, where the $(i,j)$th entry is a count of how often base-pair $i$ occurs at position $j$. Open the PWM for the CTCF motif, which can be found in `MA0139.1.jaspar`. Normalize this matrix so that each column sums to $1$."

In the methods section of the [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27197224/) (page 998), the authors describe how they converted each of the $300$ filters into normalized PWMs. First, for each filter, they determined the maximum activated value across the *dataset* (you may use a subset of the test set here). Compute these values."
